# How to change Markup (=.html/.php or .js files)
- Simply upload them to the server and push changes into git

# How to change CSS Files
- Run build pipeline --> ```npm run build```

#Setup for frontend build pipeline
1. Check if you have node & npm installed (run 'node -v' or sth similar)
2. Run ```npm install```, never add package-lock.json into git.
3. Develop in the /src folder, except js files(change them in /dist/js ) --> this is because of performance!
4. For building files run ```npm run build```
5. Upload files from /dist folder to server
